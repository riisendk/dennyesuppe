I princippet kan et hold tabe alle kampe indtil den afgørende taberfinale og stadig klare frisag.</strong></li>\n                    <li>Men hvor mange nedrykkere er der så? – <strong>Der er altid én nedrykker fra Superligaen, og altid én direkte oprykker fra 1. division. Derudover kan to yderligere hold rykke hhv. ned og op.</strong></li>\n                    <li>Hvad sker der, hvis pokalvinderen er blandt de tre øverste hold i mesterskabsspillet?– <strong>Så er det fjerdepladsen, der skal spille kvalifikationskamp om Europa League.</strong></li>\n                    <li>Hvordan er strukturen i 1. division? – <strong>Her spilles der fortsat med 12 hold, der møder hinanden 3 gange hver.</strong></li>\n                </ul>\n                <p>Tak for fordi du besøgte denne hjemmeside – du er velkommen til at køre simuleringen igennem igen, og husk så, at den
